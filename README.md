# Infinite Canvas

> This project is being built collaboratively with [Claude](https://claude.ai/claude-code) (Anthropic's AI assistant). The architecture, features, and code are developed through an iterative conversation — Claude writes and refines the implementation while the human steers the design.

Crystal + Raylib desktop app: an infinite, pannable/zoomable canvas for
sketching diagrams and taking notes. Supports rectangles with editable labels,
plain text nodes, and directional arrows connecting elements.

## Prerequisites

- Crystal >= 1.10
- Raylib 5.0 native library
- OpenSSL development libraries (required by Crystal's UUID stdlib)

On macOS: `brew install crystal raylib openssl`
On Arch: `pacman -S crystal shards raylib openssl`

### Building Raylib 5.0 locally (Debian/Ubuntu)

If a distro package for Raylib 5.0 is not available, build it from source and
install it under the repo directory so no root access is required:

```sh
# Install build tools, Raylib's system dependencies, and OpenSSL dev headers
sudo apt-get install -y cmake libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev \
    libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev \
    libssl-dev

# Clone and build Raylib 5.0
git clone --depth 1 --branch 5.0 https://github.com/raysan5/raylib
cmake raylib -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B raylib/build
cmake --build raylib/build

# Install into a local prefix (no sudo needed)
cmake --install raylib/build --prefix local
```

This places `libraylib.so` under `local/lib/`.

## Build & run

Inline `LIBRARY_PATH` when building so the linker finds the locally built Raylib:

```sh
shards install
LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/local/lib shards build --release
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/local/lib ./bin/infinite_canvas
```

When Raylib is installed system-wide (e.g. via a package manager) the environment
variables can be omitted. `env.sh` in the repo root exports both variables as a
convenience (`source env.sh`) if you prefer that workflow.

The two variables and their roles:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LIBRARY_PATH` | Tells the linker where to find `-lraylib` at **compile time** |
| `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` | Tells the dynamic loader where to find `libraylib.so` at **run time** |

You can make the run-time path permanent by adding the following line to
`/etc/ld.so.conf.d/raylib.conf` (requires root) and then running `sudo ldconfig`:

```
/absolute/path/to/local/lib
```

## Controls

### Tools

Switch tools with the keyboard. The active tool is shown in the top-left HUD.

| Key | Tool | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `S` | **Select** (default) | Click an element to select it; click empty space to deselect |
| `R` | **Rect** | Click to place a default-sized rectangle; drag to draw a custom size |
| `T` | **Text** | Click to place a text node; drag to set an initial size |
| `A` | **Arrow** | Drag from one element to another to create a directional connection |

After placing an element or drawing an arrow, the tool automatically returns to
Select and the new element is selected (arrows return to Select without selecting
the arrow itself).

### Arrows

Arrows connect two elements by UUID, so they track the elements as they are moved
or resized.

- **Routing style** — each arrow is independently either *Orthogonal* (rectilinear
  segments, default) or *Straight* (direct border-to-border line). Toggle with `Tab`
  while an arrow is selected.
- **Endpoint spreading** — when multiple orthogonal arrows share the same border side
  of an element, their exit/entry points are spread evenly along that side and ordered
  to minimise crossings.
- **Cascade delete** — deleting an element also removes all arrows connected to it.

### Editing

Select any rectangle or text node to start editing its content immediately.

| Action | Input |
|---|---|
| Insert character | Type while an element is selected |
| Insert newline | `Enter` |
| Delete character left of cursor | `Backspace` |
| Delete word left of cursor | `Ctrl+Backspace` |
| Move cursor | `←` / `→` / `↑` / `↓` |
| Jump by word | `Ctrl+←` / `Ctrl+→` |
| Extend selection | Hold `Shift` with any cursor movement key |
| Delete selection | `Backspace` with an active selection |
| Copy selection | `Ctrl+C` |
| Paste (replaces selection) | `Ctrl+V` |
| Delete element | `Delete` (also removes connected arrows) |
| Toggle arrow routing | `Tab` (while an arrow is selected) |

The cursor blinks after a short steady-on period following each keystroke, matching standard editor behaviour. Vertical navigation preserves the visual horizontal position across lines (sticky column), accounting for the proportional font.

### Text node word wrap

Text nodes auto-size to their content by default. They cap at **half the screen width** — once text would exceed this, it wraps automatically. To set a custom width, drag the **left or right resize handle** of a selected text node. From that point on the width is locked and text reflows to fit; the height always adjusts dynamically. Dragging the handle back or resizing larger works the same way. `↑` / `↓` navigate by visual (wrapped) lines when word wrap is active.

### Multiple selection

Drag an empty area with the Select tool to rubber-band select multiple elements. All selected elements can be moved together. Holding `Shift` snaps the move to the grid.

### Canvas navigation

| Action | Input |
|---|---|
| Move element | Drag a selected element (Select tool) |
| Resize element | Drag a handle on a selected element (Select tool) |
| Pan canvas | Right-drag or middle-drag |
| Zoom | Mouse wheel — snaps to well-known levels (0.25×, 0.5×, 1×, 2×, …) |
| Snap to grid | Hold `Shift` while moving or resizing |

The canvas is saved to `canvas.json` in the working directory on exit and
restored automatically on next launch.

### HUD

The top-left overlay shows the active tool, element count, and zoom level. When
an arrow is selected its routing style is shown with a reminder of the `Tab`
toggle. The bottom-right corner shows smoothed **update** and **draw** times (in
ms, exponential moving average over ~10 frames) alongside the FPS counter.

## Layout

- `src/infinite_canvas.cr` — entry point, window setup, main loop, HUD
- `src/canvas.cr` — `Canvas` class skeleton: constants, enums, state, `initialize`, `save`/`load`, `update`, `draw`
- `src/canvas_input.cr` — all input handlers (`handle_pan`, `handle_zoom`, `handle_left_mouse`, `handle_text_input`, …), hit-testing, and resize geometry
- `src/canvas_drawing.cr` — drawing helpers (`draw_grid`, `draw_selection`, `draw_draft`)
- `src/element.cr` — `Element` abstract base class and `ElementData` interface
- `src/text_editing.cr` — `TextEditing` mixin: cursor, selection, word movement, clipboard
- `src/rect_element.cr` — `RectElement`: filled rectangle with centred multi-line label
- `src/text_element.cr` — `TextElement`: plain text node, auto-sized with optional word wrap
- `src/arrow_element.cr` — `ArrowElement`: orthogonal/straight routing, endpoint spreading
- `src/persistence.cr` — JSON serialisation mirror structs for save/load
